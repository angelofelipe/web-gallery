# Goals

[] 6. Criar breadcrumbs a partir do nome das pastas que formam o caminho.

- [] 5. Develop the format of HTML pages with useful "metadata" that will invoke HTML with engraving.

- [] 4. Develop a model with neutral color palettes for the home page and a model that is dynamic for the internal pages using color variables so that the colors of the internal pages are in harmony with those of the CSS painting.

- [] 3. Create an interactive breadcrumb with JS where if one day it is necessary to modify the path in some way it can readjust itself. This may involve accessing folders and files with JS.

- [] 2. Create a way for the frames of each "internal" canvas to be the same as the one used on the home page, since from now on we will separate the frame from the CSS canvas.

- [] 1. Create a layout for the home page where each "css frame" will be in one column, we will have a maximum of three columns on a large screen.
